                questions: [
                    { q: "Lesson 1. Write Key ideas in your own words.", a: "• Washington and its neighbors are separated by natural and political borders. <br>• The places where people live and what people do are influenced by geography. <br>• Washington's resources and land have been changed by people over time. " },
                    { q: "Lesson 1. Complete “What Did You Learn?”", a: `1. Some neighbouring states of Washington are Oregon, Idaho, and British Columbia in Canada. Idaho and British Columbia are seperated by political boundaries, but Oregon is seperated by Washington on the south. The Rocky Mountains also act as a natural barrier for the East side of Washington. <br><br>
                                                    2. Geography can affect humans by providing materials and things people need to survive. For example, Washington is known for being the biggest producer of apples in the world. This is because the Rocky Mountains in central Washington affect the soil on the east coast, providing a much better place for planting apples and other crops. Washington is also known for its fish, as you can catch tons of fish on the West Coast. Geography can also influence trade. The West Coast of Washington is a trade house as many ships cross the Pacific to reach Washington. <br><br>
                                                    3. People have changed Washington's resources over time. Some resources that have been changed is the amount of wildlife in Washington. Trees were cut down, wild animals were shot, and the amount of fish in Washington reduce, specifically salmon. Dams were also built on rivers to produce hydro-electricity.`},
                    { q: "Lesson 2. Write Key ideas in your own words.", a: "• The Pacfic Northwest and the Pacific Rim includes Washington State. <br>• Washington's five land regions each have different land features that make each land region unique of eachother. <br>• The Puget Sound Lowlands contains most of Washington's population." },
                    { q: "Lesson 2. Complete “What Did You Learn?”", a: `1. Washington is part of the Pacific Northwest because of its climate. Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, all have a temperate climate with rainforests, evergreen forests, and grass lands. Washington is part of the Pacific Rim because of its location. Since Washington borders the Pacfifc Ocean, Washington can easily trade with countries across and on the Pacfic Rim. <br><br>
                                                    2. Comparing and contrasting the The Cascade Range and the Rocky Mountain Region. Both the Cascade Range and the Rocky Mountain Region are mountain ranges that are part of the Pacific Northwest. But the Cascade Range had a much higher elevation and is cold and wet on the west side, but the east side of the Cascade Range is dry and warm. This also causes the Rocky Mountains to be dry and warm. The Cascade Mountains are meant for farming, but the Rocky Mountains are meant for mining. <br><br>
                                                    3. Most of the population lives in the Puget Sound Lowlands because of its geography. The land is flat and fertile, helping with farming. The Puget Sound also has a mild climate, making it a great place for living.  Access to rivers and deepwater seaports is much easier in the Pugest Sound Lowlands, which helps with trade and travel. <br><br>` },
                    { q: "Lesson 3. Write Key ideas in your own words.", a: "• At one point, most of Washington was under the water. <br>• Our state's (Washington) mountains, valleys, and plateuas were shaped by earthquakes, volcanoes, floods<br>• Fossils can provide clues about Washington's animals and plants." },
                    { q: "Lesson 3. Use the internet (AI okay!) to ask and answer 3 authentic questions about the Mt. St. Helens eruption.", a: `Q1: How was the bulge made on the side of Mt. St. Helens? <br>A1: The bulge on the side of Mt. St. Helens was caused by magma pushed up within the peak of the mountain<br><br>
                        Q2: Did Mt. St. Helens decrease in height after the eruption? <br>A2: Mt. St. Helens did decrease in elevation by approximately 1,370 ft (from 9,677 to 8,307 feet<br><br>
                        Q3: Did some natural disasters occur because of the Mt. St. Helens eruption? <br>A3: The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens created a series of catastrophic events including the largest landslide in recorded history, a lateral blast from the top of the mountain, destructive lahars (mudflows), and widespread ashfall.`},
                    { q: "Lesson 3. Complete “What Did You Learn?”", a: `1. The coast of Washington millions of years ago was more due north-east than it is today. This is because the North American Contient was the base, and the North Cascade micro-contients along with the Olympic Peninsula and the other micro-contients were still underwater.<br><br>
                                                    2. One of the main forces that impacted Washington's landscape is micro-contients. Millions of years ago, micro-contients on the Pacific Ocean collided with the North American Plate and formed mountains such as the Olympic, Cascade, and Rocky Montains. Another force that impacted Washington's landscape is volcanic eruptions, which effected the land by creating plateaus (Columbia Plateau) and destroying wildlife. The final force that affects Washington's landscape is glaciers and ice sheets, which creates lakes and aquifers full of water.<br><br>
                                                    3. Geologists learned that there once was a large, flourishing tropical forest in Washington using ferns and other plants' fossils.  Geologists also learned that the ocean was once on top of Washington because of the discovery of bones from ancient sea life fossils on Washington land.<br><br>` },
                    { q: "Complete “Go to the Source” (pg. 31)", a: `OBSERVE <br>
                    1. The map is organized by cities poupulation in Washington's five land regions. <br>
                    2. The three biggest cities by population marked on the map are Seattle, Spokane, and Bellingham. <br>
                    3. The three smallest cities by population marked on the map are Westport, Newport, and Cle Elum. <br><br>
                    
                    EVALUATE <br>
                    1. The cities with the largest population all have near-access to rivers, giving access to trade and travel. These cities also have low elevation, which helps with farming and mining. <br>
                    2. The cities with the smallest population all have access to rivers, but the route to get to the city is long and narrow. These cities also have high elevation and are more due east of the ocean, which means it is harder to get to those cities than cities closer to water (rivers, oceans). <br><br>
                    
                    CONCLUDE <br>
                    1. More people live in the Puget Sound Lowlands - especially Seattle - because of its geography. The land is flat and fertile, helping with farming, but Seattle is a major city due to its access to rivers which helps with travel and trade trade. People usually don't live in places with high elevation (harder to access things), and in places where rivers are far away.<br><br>`}

                    <br>2. The part where I learned about the resource availability of Washington helped me understand where people lived and what they did with those resources. For example, some tribes in an area used cedar trees to build boats to hunt whales and other fish.`},

Write Key ideas in your own words.", a: "• The first to explore the Northwest Coast were Spanish and English sailors.<br>• The Columbia River was named by an American explorer and the land around the river was claimed by the same explorer. <br>• The maping of the terrain of the Northwest was helped by Lewis and Clark."},
                    { q: "Lesson 2. Find information from an outside source related to information in lesson 2 (explain how they relate).", a: "Some outside information I found from outside sources is that Lewis and Clark both joined the militia, and Lewis was commanded by Clark. This relates to the lesson because it shows how Lewis and Clark's experience in the military helped them with their journey."},
                    { q: "Lesson 3. Write Key ideas in your own words.", a: "• Along the Pacific Coast in the early 1800s, fur trading was the chief economic activity. <br>• Missionaries converting Indians to Christianity had limited success. <br>• The Indian Population declined due to diseases brought by Missionaries"},

                    { q: "End-of-Chapter Activities: Answer “Chapter Review Questions” 1-8 (pg. 57)", a: `1. Living near the Pacific Ocean influenced the lifestyle of the Costal Indians in many ways. The marine economy of different types of fish helped with trade and food. The Pacific Ocean also helped for travel (in one way connected to trade) and creating moist air on the coastlines and West Side of Washington. This moise air advantage helped with gathering animals and plants, as well as red cedar and other trees which helped with building shelter. Rivers flowing to the Pacfic Ocean helped with farming to create rich soil. <br><br>
                        2. The Plateau Indians were more likely than the Costal Indians to move around because of the different seasons. Since the Cascade Mountains blocked most moisture from the Pacific Ocean, the Plateau Indian had to deal with hot and dry summers and cold and dry winters. This cause the Plateau Indians to move around and adapt with the weather. Another reasons why Plateau Indians moved more than Costal Indians is because Horses were also introduced to the Plateau Indians by the Cayuse, which helped with traveling to hunt and gather resources. <br><br>
                        3. The thing that was unique on how women were treated in the Plateau tribes is that men and women had equality. Women had rights to reject and propose a marriage. In some households, women had a higher priority than men. An example of this is women got to control food usage, and the men had to ask for food. <br><br>

                        5. President Thomas Jefferson asked Lewis and Clark to go and explore the Louisiana Purchase. The Indian girl that helped Lewis and Clark with their expedition was Sacagawea. <br><br>
                        6. One factor that the fur trade stopped is because of sea otter and beaver population. The population was decreasing rapidly and those animals were on the line of extinction. The amount of sea otters and beavers was too small to do more round of voyaging on the seas. Another factor that put an end to the fur trade was fashion trends. Top hats were the favorite in past-time United States and Europe, but silk hats became the new trend. <br><br>
                        7. Some success that the missionaires had when converting Indians in the Oregon County were that they were able to convert a few Indian here and there and they where also able to set up churchs and mission schools to teach the Indians Christianity.
