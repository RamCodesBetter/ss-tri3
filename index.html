                questions: [
                    { q: "Lesson 1. Write Key ideas in your own words.", a: "• Washington and its neighbors are separated by natural and political borders. <br>• The places where people live and what people do are influenced by geography. <br>• Washington's resources and land have been changed by people over time. " },
                    { q: "Lesson 1. Complete “What Did You Learn?”", a: `1. Some neighbouring states of Washington are Oregon, Idaho, and British Columbia in Canada. Idaho and British Columbia are seperated by political boundaries, but Oregon is seperated by Washington on the south. The Rocky Mountains also act as a natural barrier for the East side of Washington. <br><br>
                                                    2. Geography can affect humans by providing materials and things people need to survive. For example, Washington is known for being the biggest producer of apples in the world. This is because the Rocky Mountains in central Washington affect the soil on the east coast, providing a much better place for planting apples and other crops. Washington is also known for its fish, as you can catch tons of fish on the West Coast. Geography can also influence trade. The West Coast of Washington is a trade house as many ships cross the Pacific to reach Washington. <br><br>
                                                    3. People have changed Washington's resources over time. Some resources that have been changed is the amount of wildlife in Washington. Trees were cut down, wild animals were shot, and the amount of fish in Washington reduce, specifically salmon. Dams were also built on rivers to produce hydro-electricity.`},
                    { q: "Lesson 2. Write Key ideas in your own words.", a: "• The Pacfic Northwest and the Pacific Rim includes Washington State. <br>• Washington's five land regions each have different land features that make each land region unique of eachother. <br>• The Puget Sound Lowlands contains most of Washington's population." },
                    { q: "Lesson 2. Complete “What Did You Learn?”", a: `1. Washington is part of the Pacific Northwest because of its climate. Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, all have a temperate climate with rainforests, evergreen forests, and grass lands. Washington is part of the Pacific Rim because of its location. Since Washington borders the Pacfifc Ocean, Washington can easily trade with countries across and on the Pacfic Rim. <br><br>
                                                    2. Comparing and contrasting the The Cascade Range and the Rocky Mountain Region. Both the Cascade Range and the Rocky Mountain Region are mountain ranges that are part of the Pacific Northwest. But the Cascade Range had a much higher elevation and is cold and wet on the west side, but the east side of the Cascade Range is dry and warm. This also causes the Rocky Mountains to be dry and warm. The Cascade Mountains are meant for farming, but the Rocky Mountains are meant for mining. <br><br>
                                                    3. Most of the population lives in the Puget Sound Lowlands because of its geography. The land is flat and fertile, helping with farming. The Puget Sound also has a mild climate, making it a great place for living.  Access to rivers and deepwater seaports is much easier in the Pugest Sound Lowlands, which helps with trade and travel. <br><br>` },
                    { q: "Lesson 3. Write Key ideas in your own words.", a: "• At one point, most of Washington was under the water. <br>• Our state's (Washington) mountains, valleys, and plateuas were shaped by earthquakes, volcanoes, floods<br>• Fossils can provide clues about Washington's animals and plants." },
                    { q: "Lesson 3. Use the internet (AI okay!) to ask and answer 3 authentic questions about the Mt. St. Helens eruption.", a: `Q1: How was the bulge made on the side of Mt. St. Helens? <br>A1: The bulge on the side of Mt. St. Helens was caused by magma pushed up within the peak of the mountain<br><br>
                        Q2: Did Mt. St. Helens decrease in height after the eruption? <br>A2: Mt. St. Helens did decrease in elevation by approximately 1,370 ft (from 9,677 to 8,307 feet<br><br>
                        Q3: Did some natural disasters occur because of the Mt. St. Helens eruption? <br>A3: The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens created a series of catastrophic events including the largest landslide in recorded history, a lateral blast from the top of the mountain, destructive lahars (mudflows), and widespread ashfall.`},
                    { q: "Lesson 3. Complete “What Did You Learn?”", a: `1. The coast of Washington millions of years ago was more due north-east than it is today. This is because the North American Contient was the base, and the North Cascade micro-contients along with the Olympic Peninsula and the other micro-contients were still underwater.<br><br>
                                                    2. One of the main forces that impacted Washington's landscape is micro-contients. Millions of years ago, micro-contients on the Pacific Ocean collided with the North American Plate and formed mountains such as the Olympic, Cascade, and Rocky Montains. Another force that impacted Washington's landscape is volcanic eruptions, which effected the land by creating plateaus (Columbia Plateau) and destroying wildlife. The final force that affects Washington's landscape is glaciers and ice sheets, which creates lakes and aquifers full of water.<br><br>
                                                    3. Geologists learned that there once was a large, flourishing tropical forest in Washington using ferns and other plants' fossils.  Geologists also learned that the ocean was once on top of Washington because of the discovery of bones from ancient sea life fossils on Washington land.<br><br>` },
                    { q: "Complete “Go to the Source” (pg. 31)", a: `OBSERVE <br>
                    1. The map is organized by cities poupulation in Washington's five land regions. <br>
                    2. The three biggest cities by population marked on the map are Seattle, Spokane, and Bellingham. <br>
                    3. The three smallest cities by population marked on the map are Westport, Newport, and Cle Elum. <br><br>
                    
                    EVALUATE <br>
                    1. The cities with the largest population all have near-access to rivers, giving access to trade and travel. These cities also have low elevation, which helps with farming and mining. <br>
                    2. The cities with the smallest population all have access to rivers, but the route to get to the city is long and narrow. These cities also have high elevation and are more due east of the ocean, which means it is harder to get to those cities than cities closer to water (rivers, oceans). <br><br>
                    
                    CONCLUDE <br>
                    1. More people live in the Puget Sound Lowlands - especially Seattle - because of its geography. The land is flat and fertile, helping with farming, but Seattle is a major city due to its access to rivers which helps with travel and trade trade. People usually don't live in places with high elevation (harder to access things), and in places where rivers are far away.<br><br>`}

Write Key ideas in your own words.", a: "• The first to explore the Northwest Coast were Spanish and English sailors.<br>• The Columbia River was named by an American explorer and the land around the river was claimed by the same explorer. <br>• The maping of the terrain of the Northwest was helped by Lewis and Clark."},
                    { q: "Lesson 2. Find information from an outside source related to information in lesson 2 (explain how they relate).", a: "Some outside information I found from outside sources is that Lewis and Clark both joined the militia, and Lewis was commanded by Clark. This relates to the lesson because it shows how Lewis and Clark's experience in the military helped them with their journey."},
                    { q: "Lesson 3. Write Key ideas in your own words.", a: "• Along the Pacific Coast in the early 1800s, fur trading was the chief economic activity. <br>• Missionaries converting Indians to Christianity had limited success. <br>• The Indian Population declined due to diseases brought by Missionaries"},

                    { q: "End-of-Chapter Activities: Answer “Chapter Review Questions” 1-8 (pg. 57)", a: `1. Living near the Pacific Ocean influenced the lifestyle of the Costal Indians in many ways. The marine economy of different types of fish helped with trade and food. The Pacific Ocean also helped for travel (in one way connected to trade) and creating moist air on the coastlines and West Side of Washington. This moise air advantage helped with gathering animals and plants, as well as red cedar and other trees which helped with building shelter. Rivers flowing to the Pacfic Ocean helped with farming to create rich soil. <br><br>
                        2. The Plateau Indians were more likely than the Costal Indians to move around because of the different seasons. Since the Cascade Mountains blocked most moisture from the Pacific Ocean, the Plateau Indian had to deal with hot and dry summers and cold and dry winters. This cause the Plateau Indians to move around and adapt with the weather. Another reasons why Plateau Indians moved more than Costal Indians is because Horses were also introduced to the Plateau Indians by the Cayuse, which helped with traveling to hunt and gather resources. <br><br>
                        3. The thing that was unique on how women were treated in the Plateau tribes is that men and women had equality. Women had rights to reject and propose a marriage. In some households, women had a higher priority than men. An example of this is women got to control food usage, and the men had to ask for food. <br><br>

                        5. President Thomas Jefferson asked Lewis and Clark to go and explore the Louisiana Purchase. The Indian girl that helped Lewis and Clark with their expedition was Sacagawea. <br><br>
                        6. One factor that the fur trade stopped is because of sea otter and beaver population. The population was decreasing rapidly and those animals were on the line of extinction. The amount of sea otters and beavers was too small to do more round of voyaging on the seas. Another factor that put an end to the fur trade was fashion trends. Top hats were the favorite in past-time United States and Europe, but silk hats became the new trend. <br><br>
                        7. Some success that the missionaires had when converting Indians in the Oregon County were that they were able to convert a few Indian here and there and they where also able to set up churchs and mission schools to teach the Indians Christianity. Multiple other missionaires built more missions to teach the Indians how to do basic agricultural practices and how to read the Bible. But the missionaires also failed to convert the Indians to Christianity because of the Indians' strong connection to their culture and traditions. <br><br>
                        8. The disease affected Native Americans Indians by wiping and rapidly decreasing the population of Indians. The wagon train mission brought sick travelers and the Whitman's mission spread the diseases further outward, creating an epidemic. This is worse than normall because the Indians had no immunity because tehy have never been in contact with these disease before.`},

                    { q: "Lesson 1. Write Key ideas in your own words.", a: "• Along the Oregon Trail, thousands of pioneers traveled to settle in the Pacific Northwest. <br>• Pioneers moved west because of cheap land, business opportunities, and adventure. <br>• Before small towns and cities began to grow, there was a huge wave of settlement mainly on farms."},
                    { q: "Lesson 1: What did you Learn?", a: `1. The trip was slightly easy because of the flat plains. But the Oregon Trail was tough because they had to cross many rivers, deal with the weather, hot and dusty areas or wet and muddy areas. <br><br>
                                        2. Many people wanted to move west because of cheap yet fertile land, business opportunities, escaping slavery, live in a healthy climate, or the chance to be in a new part of the country. <br><br>
                                        3. George Washington Bush was a war veteran and a fortunate cattle handler in Missouri who owned one of the most productive farms in the area (named Bush farm). The town of Bush Prairie was named after him. <br><br>
                                        4. The person who wanted to buy a piece of land (called homesteaders) went to the closet office they could find. The homesteader would locate a quarter section on the map to claim, and the homesteader would go and mark the corners of the land. Afterwards, the homesteader would go back to the office and claim the land, but the land would have to be advertised in newspaper, so the land can be challenged by others. The advertisement served as profit for the newspaper.`},
                    { q: "Lesson 2. Write Key ideas in your own words.", a: "• Pioneers recall happy times, even though disease, bad crops and weather could make life difficult. <br>• Mining, lumber, fishing, and whaling industries helped settlers with living in the Pacific Northwest. <br>• The most important crops for farmers in Washington were wheat and apples."},
                    { q: "Lesson 2. What did you Learn?", a: `1. Early settlers in the Pacific Northwest had many difficulties. This includes terrible weather which affects the freezing of rivers, and the piles of snow that reached ten feet. Diseases also was a difficulty because germs that spread in the area were not treatable because the doctors did not know that the germs caused diseases. Poor food was another difficulty because pork was the only meat available, and every so often beef was killed and exchanged. Flour was also really hard to get. <br><br>
                                        2. Lumber, fishing, and whaling were overall gave a better living than mining in the Northwest because there was an abundance of trees, fish, and whales to catch. These jobs provide long-term jobs and helped support communities. Mining was risky, dangerous, and the population of coal and/or other ores could run out quickly. <br><br>
                                        3. Wheat was a key crop of Washington because it spread across Eastern Washington, mainly the Palouse region. This caused wheat to be 45% of Washington's crop value. Apples were another key crop of Washington because of the irrigrated orchards and the abundance of apple trees the growers planted. The railroad built nearby helped with the transportation of the apples before they were ruined, growing Washington's apple production.`},
                    { q: "Lesson 3. Write Key ideas in your own words.", a: "• Boundary issues were settles by treaties with Britian and Spain. <br>• The desire for western expansion grew because of a belief in Manifest Destiny. <br>• The topic of seperation from the Oregon Territory was brought up by settlers; therefore, the Washington Territory was made in 1853."},
                    { q: "Lesson 3. What did you Learn?", a: `1. The Treaty of Oregon was where the Britians agreed to give up their land below the 49th parallel to the U.S.. The 49th parallel is also now the border between the U.S. and Canada. <br><br>
                                        2. Americans were so interested in westward expansion because of the belief in Manifest Destiny. Manifest Destiny was the American's divine mission to spread political and religious values to others. Many people that held this belief wanted to gain control over the Oregon Territory as well as an expansion of land from Texas to California. <br><br>
                                        3. The Washington Territory was created because settlers who moved north of the Columbia river thought that the government leaders of Oregon were far out, and the territory of Oregon was too big for the settlers.`},

                questions: [
                    { q: "Lesson 1: What did you Learn?", a: `1. The purpose of these treaties was to acquire land from the Native Americans to expand the United States's Land. <br><br>
                                        2. The treaty of 1855 was where the Native Americans agreed to give up their land to the U.S. in exchange for a reservation. <br><br>
                                        3. The treaty of 1859 was where the Native Americans agreed to give up their land to the U.S. in exchange for a reservation. <br><br>`},
                    { q: "Lesson 2. Analyze one sentence you think is important in this lesson.", a: "I analyzed the sentence \"Gold seekers rushed into the area, trespassing on lands given to the Yakamsa in the treaty.\" Who is doing the action: the gold seekers. What did they do: rushed into the area. Tresspassing usually means entering an area illegally or with no permission, and the land given to the Yakama meant that the land legally belonged to the Yakama. In the treaty is referring to an official agreement between the Native Americans and the U.S. What the quote is saying is that people searching for gold entering the Yakama territory without permission, although the land was legally promised to the Yakama in a treaty."},
                    { q: "Lesson 2. What did you Learn?", a: `1. White settlers disregarded the treaty by the Native Americans and the U.S. because their was a discorvery of gold there. This resulted in white settlers tresspassing on the land; therefore, the U.S. gave some land to the white settlers, forcing the Native Americans to move. <br><br>
                                        2. The result of the Indians wars was that the Native Americans were being crowded by white settlers, forcing them out of their homes and into reservations. Two acts were passed, the Indian Homestead Act which gave each individual a piece of property (although the ownership of land was not valued compared to white settlers), and the Dawes Act which divided reservation into smaller plots of land. This was done to encourage the Native Americans to become farmers, but most of the land was dry or not fertile for farming. The Dawes act also created Indian boarding schools which were to change Indian's into white culture. <br><br>
                                        3. White cultural values influenced new policies and laws because the white settlers wanted to make sure the Native's weren't a threat. Manifest Destiny also made them thing that the white culture was more superior, leding to the creation of the Dawes Act.`},
                    { q: "Analyze one sentence you think is important in this lesson.", a: "I analyzed the setence \"In the summer of that year, territorial officials convened a constitutional convention in Walla Walla and began work on a state constitution.\" Who is doing the action: territorial officials. What did they do: convened a constitutional convention. Convene means bringing a group together, and a constitutional convention is a meeting of representatives to write a constitution. The quote is trying to say that the Washington territorial officials brang the representatives together to write a state constitusion in Walla Walla."},
                    { q: "Lesson 3. What did you Learn?", a: `1. First Washington needed to have a population of 60,000. Afterwards, territorial legislature need to draft a state constitution that would uphold the principles of the federal constitution. Creation of a new public school system was the last requirement. <br><br>
                                        2. Washington upheld the Bill of Rights from the U.S. Constitution, but Washington clarified rights not addressed or vaguely worded. They were more clear on specific requirements to build public school systems and bearing arms. Our constitution is much more longer than the U.S. Constitution because it is much more specific. There are more articles as well (31 articles in Washington's constitution compared to 7 in the U.S. Constitution), and the Washington Constitution also has been amended 98 times compared to 27 times in the U.S. Constitution. <br><br>
                                        3. In 1883, Washington - as a territory - approved a suffare bill which allowed women to vote. However, women only had 5 years to vote until the link was overturned. Then in 1910, the problem was fixed again in 1910 when women were allowed to vote in Washington. Then 10 years later in 1920, women were allowed to vote nationally.`},

                    { q: "Read lesson 1 & Answer: What are some ways the Great Northern Railroad and the Northern Pacific Railroad impacted WA state?", a: `According to the textbook on pages 108 and 109, the Northen Pacific Railroad influenced Washington State by decreasing journey time. In the past the amount of time it took was 6 times shorter than before. The Northen Pacific Railroad connected with many other industries such as timber production and coal mines. Timber was used to build railroad ties, train stations, etc. The Northen Pacific Railroad increased coal production due to the fact that the trains ran off tons of coal. Extreme usage of coal encouraged the development of coal mines in the west. <br><br>
                                        The textbook mentioned in pages 112 and 113, that the Great Northern Railroad was completely covered by the president James Hill money-wise. (The government did not cover the project.) This railroad influenced Washington State because it was increasing the growth of the economy in Seattle. The railroad also was much cheaper by 2 times than the Northern Pacific Railroad. Freight charges for shipping goods were also less. This caused a huge growth in the timber industry. Hill, being a student of agricultural science, influenced Washington State because farmers could board his train asking experts for farming advice. This success influenced Washington State (again) because it bankrupted the Northern Pacific Railroad. (The Northern Pacific Railroad was later bought by the Great Northern Railroad.)`},
